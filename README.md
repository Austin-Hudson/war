### War
##### Overview
This version of War uses two players to play the traditional game of War.
##### How the Game Works
The controls uses mouse clicks. It's you versus another person. The
key presses do everything for you. When there is "War", the application solves the answer and outputs the flipped over cards. It uses the traditional rules of War to play the game.
##### Technology Used
This application uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.
##### Unsolved Problems
The game has been working as intended.

I plan on expanding the controls. So both players don't press the same button to play as well as adding statistics to it for the players.

NOTE: Since war is a VERY long game in how I implemented it, each player has to do a click. That's ALOT of clicks. On lines 76-80, in war.js I put in a debugging feature where it keeps doing the calls until the game is finished, until it gets to the end game state. I have what is happening getting printed out in the console.
